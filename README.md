# Financial Risk Analysis (Python)

## Business Context
Financial institutions must assess applicant risk accurately to reduce loan default rates and maintain portfolio stability.

## Problem Statement
Analyze applicant financial data to identify patterns associated with high-risk profiles.

## Dataset Overview
- Applicant income
- Debt ratio
- Credit history
- Employment status
- Loan status (Default / Non-Default)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Feature relationship analysis
4. Risk segmentation
5. Visualization of risk indicators

## Key Insights
- Higher debt-to-income ratios correlated with default risk.
- Applicants with unstable employment showed higher default rates.
- Certain income brackets demonstrated lower risk profiles.

## Business Recommendations
- Implement stricter thresholds for high debt ratios.
- Adjust interest rates based on segmented risk categories.
- Introduce additional verification for high-risk applicants.
